# 52째North Student Innovation Challenge 2024

The 52째North Student Innovation Prize has a long history of creative concepts being
developed and implemented by students. In previous iterations, we kept the technological
areas open to allow many different aspects and problems from the geoinformation world to
be covered. For this years iterations we decided to follow a different path and provide
a pre-defined problem statement while allowing students to get creative in the area
of solution development.

## Problem statement

We identified a problem that affects all research areas of 52째North: **searchability in
Research and Spatial Data Infrastructures** (RDI/SDI). Search functionality in such systems
is generally limited to a metadata based approach. Geo data - being vector or raster based -
though provides a lot of interesting data which currently can only be identified when
looking at the individual dataset. The challenge of this years Innovation Prize is to
develop a concept and possible implementation that allows searching within datasets of
and RDI/SDI, e.g. on the attribute level. Many interesting aspects need to be thought
of: techical solutions, taxonomies and semantics, language/i18n, searching in raster data,
and many more.

Software engineers at 52째North have preprared a set of User Stories and features that
have been identified in project work over the last few years. These User Stories provide
details on the initial problem statement and related specific aspects. They define a rough
catalogue of features, thought it is not required to cover all of them. Likewise they
should not limit the scope of a proposal. The User Stories are organized in a GitHub project:

## What do we expect from a proposal?

Your proposal should involve identifying and tackling technological challenges through
in-depth research to propose potential solutions. Try to show that you have a comprehensive
grasp of the problem, architecture, components, and protocols. Additionally, explore potential
extra benefits that could result from the overall architecture. Feel free to introduce your
innovative ideas or alternative solutions and concepts to enrich your proposal. It's essential
to consider a realistic plan, taking into account the given circumstances like the timeframe
and allocated hours. Throughout the proposal submission phase, we encourage active engagement
and collaboration by raising questions and sharing your thoughts on specific aspects using
GitHub issues. This collaborative approach ensures a dynamic and transparent exchange of ideas
among applying students in the project. You should use this GitHub repository:
